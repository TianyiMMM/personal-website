<p>      I'm Tianyi, a junior math major at the University of Rochester. 
<br><br>      You may think math majors don't know how to program, but That is not true. 
I've done several hackathons before, each has taught me new skills (both soft and hard). (for a complete list of project done, both personal and in-class, see <a href="project.html">here</a>)(still updating)
Besides hackathons, I'm currently working with Prof. Alex Iosevich, from our math department, 
where I used Python, NumPy and Pandas to test our estimation hypothesis. My program run for
 primes up to 1,000,000! I guess you could call it "Scientific Computing"!
<br><br>      Before this research experience, I've worked at Advanced Institute of Information Technology, 
Peking University based in Hangzhou, China, on Data Mining. I mainly worked on back-end and data cleansing and presentation and in the end with the team landed a new project for the company! Isn't that cool?
<br><br>      Of course, because of my interest in programming, I've taken my fair share of cs classes. Intro, Data Structure, Algorithm, System, you name it. Because of my classes, I also have became fairly comfortable
with terminals, the Linux operating system, Eclipse, and text editors like emacs and sublime text.
<br><br>      In addition, I am also challenging myself with LeetCode question to brush up my foundamentals.
<br><br>      Currently, my main interest is software engineering. I used to be very interested in research, but I am deeply attracted by the get-your-hands-dirty attitute of software engineering. So I switched my interests and plan on either getting a job in software engineering or getting a master in computer science after graduation. If you are interested in working with me on anything at all please see the contact page.
